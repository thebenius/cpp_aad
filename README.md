C++ Algorithms and Datastructures

---

## Purpose

For **Educational Purpose** we reimplemented common Algorithms and Datastructures in C++.

The purpose of this repository is to provide one way to implement important classes of the STL (plus some additional) for reference and study purposes. For production, please use the original STL.

---

## Feedback

Please feel free to give any feedback or opinion about the implementation. Keep in mind that we intend to keep the behaviour as close as possible to the STL.

Feel free to browser the code and ask questions at any point.
